/* General Service for the Crownstone
 *
 * There are several characteristics that fit into the general service description. There is a characteristic
 * that measures the temperature, there are several characteristics that defines the crownstone, namely by
 * name, by type, or by location (room), and there is a characteristic to update its firmware.
 *
 * If meshing is enabled, it is also possible to send a message into the mesh network using a characteristic.
